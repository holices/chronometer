# Timer
  
> Status: Developed âœ…

<img src="project_image.png">

The timer/pomodoro design was developed especially for studies/moments that require total focus. 

### Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT

With it you can enable and disable background music (in this case, lo-fi), determine the time required for each cycle and also sounds when the timer starts and ends

### Challenges encountered while developing your project
I had some difficulties during the development of this project, specifically in the timer logic, and I learned how to add sounds to the icons, something I didn't know.
